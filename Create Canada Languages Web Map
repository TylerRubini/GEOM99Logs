1) Download StatsCan language data and join to provinces data on province English name field in ArcGIS Pro. Export new feature class containing language data.
2) Export feature class to shapefile and place shapefile in same place on both local PC and server.
2.1) Important: after exporting, remove feature class from ArcGIS Pro and import shapefile from hard drive into project, otherwise referencing will not work. Spent too long figuring this one out.
3) Reference map data as per standard workflow (see link #1 in resources for workflow log)
4) Add CanadaLanguage to AGOL using server URL as per standard workflow (see link #2 in resources for workflow log)
5) Create web map containing CanadaLanguage layer.
6) Add CanadaLanguage to AGOL again, this time remembering to add the layer number to the end of the URL.
7) Create web map containing properly-added CanadaLanguage layer.
8) Alter symbology in AGOL: right hand side, choose English name field as attribute to map by
9) Save map

Outcomes:
I now have a styled map of Canadian provinces with linked census language data to use in a dashboard

Next steps:
Create dashboard around map
