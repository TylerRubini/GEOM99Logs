1) Connect to server in ArcGIS Pro (see resources section for log link) and bring in relevant data to new map
2) Place data in the same location on both the local computer and the server (c:/gisworkspace/Canada in this case)
3) Right-click server in catalog pane, select publish, map service, then select map containing relevant data. Fill in details.
3.1) If there is no publish option, double-check that correct port has been included when connecting to server
4) Click analyze and resolve any errors/warnings. Remove base maps from project to avoid warnings. Ensure that data is being referenced if intent is not to copy to server.
5) Click publish. This may take a few minutes.
6) Refresh server in catalog to check that upload was successful.

Outcomes:
CanadaDemo data has been copied manually to location on server and on local PC.
CanadaDemo data has been referenced using ArcGIS Pro.
Data can be accessed under the servers dropdown in the catalogue pane.
